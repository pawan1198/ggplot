#  The Working Directory
The working directory is a file path that R will use as the starting point for relative file paths. That is, it's the default location for importing and exporting files. An example of a working directory looks like "/file/path"
```
#Returns your current working directory
getwd()

#Changes your current working directory to a desired file path
setwd("~/R")
```

# Using Packages in R
R packages are collections of functions and tools developed by the R community. They increase the power of R by improving existing base R functionalities, or by adding new ones.
```
# Lets you install new packages (e.g., tidyverse package)
install.packages("tidyverse")

#Lets you load and use packages (e.g., tidyverse package)
library(tidyverse)
```

# Vector in R
Vector is one-dimension arrays that can hold numeric data, character data, or logical data. In other words, a vector is a simple tool to store data.

## Types of Vector
1. Numeric Vector (e.g 1,2,3)
- Numeric vector can be a numeric or an integer.  
2. Characters (e.g "a", "b", "r-language",)  
3. Factor (categorize the data and store it as levels)  
4. Boolean (True/False)  

## Creating Vectors in R

- There are two ways to create a vector i) using comma (,), ii) using colon (:)
```{r} 
## Numeric Vector
c(1,3,5) ## numeric
c(1:7)   ## integer

## Character Vector
c("a","b","hello")
```

Here "c" means "combine", and which is represent as the vector is an one dimensional. 

- We can store or save vector using this "->" 
```{r}
c(1:10)->v
v
c(1,2,3,4)->v1
v1
c("my","vector")->vector
vector
```

- Check vector 
```{r}
class(v)
class(v1)
class(vector)
```
- Create a vector with a specified interval between each element
```{r}
seq(1,20,by = 3)
## Same as 
c(seq(1,20,by = 3))
```
- We can create a vector of with repeated elements as well a number of times
```{r}
rep(3, times = 4)
rep(3,4)
rep(c(1:4), times = 4)
rep(c(1:4),each = 4)
```


## Vector Functions in R
+ `sort(my_vector)` : Returns my_vector sorted
+ `rev(my_vector)` : Reverses the order of my_vector
+ `table(my_vector)` : Count the values in a vector
+ `unique(my_vector)` : Distinct elements in a vector

```{r}
## First let's create a dummy vecrtor
c(1,3,5,2,7,4,9,24,12,25,13,22,12,3,4,6,10,9,25,22,22,21,12)->a
a
sort(a)
rev(a)
table(a)
unique(a)
```
<!-- ## Selecting Vector  -->
<!-- + `vector[6]` : sixth element -->
<!-- + `vector[-6]` : all elements but not sixth -->
<!-- + `vector[2:6]` : elements two to six -->
<!-- + `vector[-(2:6)]` : except elements between the second and the sixth -->
<!-- + `vector[c(2,6)]` : second and sixth elements -->
<!-- + `vector[vector == 5]` : elements equal to 5 -->
<!-- + `vector[vector < 5 ]` : elements less than 5 -->
<!-- + `vector[vector %in% c(2, 5 ,8 )]` : a set of elements in the set {2, 5, 8}  -->

<!-- ```{r} -->
<!-- c(c("Sun","Mon","Tue","Wed","Thurs","Fri","Sat"), -->
<!--   c(1:7))->vector1 -->
<!-- vector1 -->
<!-- vector1[6] -->
<!-- vector1[-6] -->
<!-- vector1[2:6] -->
<!-- vector1[-(2:6)] -->
<!-- vector1[c(2,6)] -->
<!-- vector1[vector1 == 5] -->
<!-- vector1[vector1 < 5 ] -->
<!-- vector1[vector1 %in% c(2, 5 ,"Sun", "Tue")] -->

<!-- ``` -->

# Data Frames 
A data frame has a data set of columns and rows. The basic syntex of data frame we can write as

<b>DF(row, column)</b>  or we can also write as
<b>DF[i,j]</b>    

Here, i refer to row and j refer to column. Note that the first argument before comma always specify the row and the second argument after the comma specify the column

e.g. ```data[1:9,c(2,5,6)]``` the first nine rows and column no 2, 5 and 6.

Basically, a data frame is a set collection of vectors. In a data frame every column represent a particular type of vector (numeric, character, factor).

+ Let's creates the data frame named as df  

```{r} 
data.frame(x = 1:7,
           y = c("Sun","Mon","Tue","Wed","Thurs","Fri","Sat")) -> df
df
```

Using <b>as.data.frame</b> command we can change a vector to data frame.

```{r}
df[ ,2]  ##selects all columns of the second row  
```
```{r}
df$x  ## selects the column x  
```
```{r}  
df[2, ] ## selects all rows of the second column
```

# Combine two Data Frames

We can combine two data frames by coloumns or by rows as well  

```{r}
df1 <- data.frame(x = 1:3, y = c("a", "b", "c"), z = 12:14)
df2 <- data.frame(x = 4:6, y = c("A", "B", "C"), z = 21:23)

cbind(df1,df2)  ## by coloumns

rbind(df1,df2)  ## by rows
```

## Subset of Data frame
We can also pick a subset from data frame 

```subset(data1,var1>10000)->data2``` A subset of data frame data1 and store it into data2, which will be also a data frame. 

```subset(data1,select=c("var1","var5","var10"))->data2 ``` Also we can select a subset by selecting particular columns as we want.
